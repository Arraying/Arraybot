# Arraybot

Arraybot is an elite multipurpose bot with advanced custom commands.
It is being developed by my humble self and the rest of the development team.
The programs that run the bot are written in multiple different languages including Java, Kotlin and Go.
This is the repository for the main bot, other parts of the program are in separate repositories.
If you intend to self-host this for non-official purposes you will receive no support.

## Getting started

In order to use the bot, simply [invite](http://invite.arraybot.xyz) it to your guild. It's as simple as that. 

#### Using Arraybot

If you're new, just execute `//help` in a channel where Arraybot can read and send messages. It will give you a quick start with the bot.

#### Support

Please read the wiki [here](https://github.com/Arraying/Arraybot/wiki), or seek support in the [guild](http://guild.arraybot.xyz).

## Running Arraybot

Arraybot comes hosted for you, if you would like to compile it and run it yourself, we are not stopping you. However, the bot setup is quite tedious if you don't know what you are doing, and we will not help you set it up yourself.
